1. What is Django, and what are its main features?


Django Overview:
Django is a high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle and emphasizes reusability, modularity, and security.

Main Features of Django:
MVT (Model-View-Template) Architecture – A structured way to build web applications, separating data management, business logic, and presentation.

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) – Django’s built-in ORM allows interaction with the database using Python instead of SQL.

Admin Interface – Automatically generated admin panel to manage database models.

Security – Django has built-in protection against SQL injection, CSRF, XSS, and clickjacking.

Scalability – Used by large websites like Instagram and Pinterest.

Built-in Authentication – Provides user authentication, including login, logout, and session management.

Middleware Support – Allows request and response processing at different stages.

Templating Engine – Built-in templating system to render dynamic content.

URL Routing – Allows mapping of URLs to specific views.

Cachability – Built-in caching framework for performance optimization.




2. What is Django ORM? How is it different from SQLAlchemy?
Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):
Django ORM is an abstraction layer that allows developers to interact with databases using Python code instead of raw SQL queries. It translates high-level model definitions into SQL statements.

Differences between Django ORM and SQLAlchemy:
Feature                   Django ORM	                                                          SQLAlchemy
Approach	            Uses a declarative approach for defining models	                     Uses both declarative and imperative approaches
Flexibility	          Tightly integrated with Django	                                     More flexible and can be used independently
Query Construction	  Simple and high-level abstraction	                                   More control over query construction
Eager vs. Lazy Loading	Supports automatic lazy loading	                                   Explicitly supports eager and lazy loading
Database Support	      Limited customization for multiple DBs	                           More powerful multi-database support


Django ORM is simpler and easier for Django applications, whereas SQLAlchemy offers greater flexibility and fine-grained control.

3. Explain Django's MVT architecture.


MVT (Model-View-Template) Architecture:
MVT is Django’s implementation of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, where:

Model (M): Represents the database and data structure.
View (V): Handles business logic and processes requests.
Template (T): Defines how the data is presented to the user.


Flow of MVT Architecture:
User requests a URL → The request is processed by Django’s URL dispatcher.
View processes the request → Fetches data from the database via Models.
Template renders the response → View sends the data to the Template for rendering.
Response is returned to the user → The final HTML is sent to the browser.



4. What are Django models? How do you define a model?
Django Models:
Django models are Python classes that define the structure of the database table. Each model maps to a database table and contains fields representing the table columns.


from django.db import models

class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    hire_date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


Key Model Features:
Each field in the model corresponds to a database column.
Django automatically creates SQL tables from models.
Models support relationships using ForeignKey, OneToOneField, and ManyToManyField.


5. How does Django handle database migrations?
Django uses a migration system to track and apply database schema changes.
Steps in Django Migrations:

Create migrations after model changes:
python manage.py makemigrations

Apply migrations to the database:
python manage.py migrate

Check applied migrations:
python manage.py showmigrations

Benefits of Django Migrations:
Tracks database changes over time.
Allows version control of schema.
Supports multiple databases.

6. What is the difference between ForeignKey, OneToOneField, and ManyToManyField?
Field Type	        Relationship           Type	Example
ForeignKey	        Many-to-One	One        Employee belongs to One Department, but a Department can have many Employees.
OneToOneField	      One-to-One	           One User has one Profile.
ManyToManyField	    Many-to-Many	         One Student can enroll in multiple Courses, and one Course can have multiple Students.

class Department(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Employee(models.Model):
    department = models.ForeignKey(Department, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Many-to-One
    profile = models.OneToOneField('Profile', on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # One-to-One
    skills = models.ManyToManyField('Skill')  # Many-to-Many


7. What are Django signals? How are they used?
Django Signals:
Django signals allow decoupled components to communicate and execute code when specific events occur.

Common Use Cases:
Auto-creating a profile when a user is created.
Sending notifications when an event occurs.



from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from .models import Profile

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        Profile.objects.create(user=instance)


Here, a Profile is automatically created when a new User is registered.



8. How does Django handle authentication and authorization?
Django provides built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Authentication (User Management):
django.contrib.auth provides user authentication.
Supports login/logout, password hashing, and session management.

Authorization (Permissions & Groups):
Permissions can be set at the model and view levels.
Groups allow managing multiple users with the same permissions.


from django.contrib.auth.models import User

user = User.objects.create_user(username='john', password='secret123')
user.is_staff = True  # Grants admin access
user.save()


9. What is middleware in Django? Can you name some built-in middlewares?
Middleware in Django:
Middleware is a framework that processes requests and responses globally before they reach the view.

Built-in Middlewares:
SecurityMiddleware – Protects against security vulnerabilities.
SessionMiddleware – Enables session support.
AuthenticationMiddleware – Manages user authentication.
CSRF Middleware – Protects against CSRF attacks.
CommonMiddleware – Provides various utilities like URL rewriting.

Middleware is configured in settings.py under MIDDLEWARE.


10. Explain the role of settings.py in a Django project.
Role of settings.py:
Configures Django’s behavior, including:
Database settings
Installed apps
Middleware
Static and media files
Security settings
Authentication backends


DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'myuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}




1. How do you optimize database queries in Django?
Optimizing database queries in Django is essential for performance and scalability. Here are several techniques:

Techniques for Query Optimization:
Use select_related and prefetch_related
Reduces the number of database queries when dealing with relationships.
select_related: Uses SQL JOIN for foreign key relationships.
prefetch_related: Uses additional queries for many-to-many relationships.



Example of inefficient query:

employees = Employee.objects.all()
for emp in employees:
    print(emp.department.name)  # Causes multiple queries


Optimized version:

employees = Employee.objects.select_related('department')
Use only() and defer()

Fetch only necessary fields to reduce memory usage.

Employee.objects.only("name", "email")  # Fetch only name and email
Employee.objects.defer("profile_picture")  # Fetch all except profile_picture
Indexing Fields

Use indexes on fields that are frequently queried.

class Employee(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True, db_index=True)
Use values() and values_list() for large datasets

Instead of fetching full objects, fetch only needed fields:

Employee.objects.values('id', 'name')  # Returns dict
Employee.objects.values_list('id', 'name', flat=True)  # Returns tuple
Use Database Transactions (atomic)

Prevents unnecessary database writes.

from django.db import transaction

with transaction.atomic():
    emp = Employee.objects.get(id=1)
    emp.salary = 60000
    emp.save()
Use Caching

Store query results in cache instead of hitting the database every time.



2. What is the difference between select_related and prefetch_related?

Feature	select_related	prefetch_related
Use Case	              Many-to-One (ForeignKey)	                Many-to-Many (ManyToManyField)
Query Execution	        Uses SQL JOIN	                            Executes multiple queries
Performance	            Faster for One-to-One and ForeignKey	    Faster for Many-to-Many
Example	                .select_related('department')	            .prefetch_related('projects')

Example Usage:

employees = Employee.objects.select_related('department')  # ForeignKey (efficient JOIN)
employees = Employee.objects.prefetch_related('skills')  # ManyToMany (efficient batch queries)


3. How does Django handle caching?
Django supports caching to improve performance and reduce database load.

Types of Caching in Django:
File-based caching – Stores cache in files.
Database caching – Uses the database as a cache.
Memory caching – Uses in-memory storage like Redis or Memcached.
Per-view caching – Caches specific views.
Template caching – Caches templates.

Example Using Redis Cache:

CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.redis.RedisCache',
        'LOCATION': 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1',
    }
}


4. What are class-based views (CBVs), and how are they different from function-based views (FBVs)?


Feature	              Function-Based Views (FBVs)	                  Class-Based Views (CBVs)
Implementation	      Uses functions	                              Uses classes
Reusability	          Less reusable	                                More reusable and extendable
Readability	          Simple and explicit	                          More structured
Example	              def my_view(request):                         ...	class MyView(View): ...

Example of FBV:

def employee_list(request):
    employees = Employee.objects.all()
    return render(request, "employees.html", {"employees": employees})

Example of CBV:

from django.views import View

class EmployeeListView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        employees = Employee.objects.all()
        return render(request, "employees.html", {"employees": employees})


5. How can you deploy a Django application?
Steps to Deploy a Django App:
Set Up a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure ALLOWED_HOSTS and DEBUG=False in settings.py

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["yourdomain.com"]
DEBUG = False

Use Gunicorn as the WSGI Server

pip install gunicorn
gunicorn --workers 3 project_name.wsgi

Set Up Nginx/Apache for Reverse Proxy

Use PostgreSQL for Production

Enable HTTPS using Let’s Encrypt

Configure a Process Manager like Supervisor or Systemd

Run Migrations & Collect Static Files

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic


6. What is Django Rest Framework (DRF)? Why is it used?
Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit for building REST APIs in Django.

Why use DRF?
Provides serialization and authentication.
Built-in support for pagination, permissions, and throttling.
Supports both class-based views (CBVs) and viewsets.

Example API using DRF:

from rest_framework import serializers, viewsets
from .models import Employee

class EmployeeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Employee
        fields = '__all__'

class EmployeeViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Employee.objects.all()
    serializer_class = EmployeeSerializer


7. How do you implement JWT authentication in Django?
Steps to Implement JWT Authentication:
Install djangorestframework_simplejwt:

pip install djangorestframework_simplejwt
Add to settings.py:

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    )
}
Generate JWT tokens:

from rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens import RefreshToken

def get_tokens_for_user(user):
    refresh = RefreshToken.for_user(user)
    return {"refresh": str(refresh), "access": str(refresh.access_token)}\


8. How do you handle file uploads in Django?
Steps for Handling File Uploads:
Define a Model:

class Document(models.Model):
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='uploads/')
Create a Form:

from django import forms
from .models import Document

class DocumentForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Document
        fields = ['file']
Configure MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT in settings.py:

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')



9. How does Django manage sessions?
Uses database-backed sessions by default (django.contrib.sessions).

Supports file-based, cached, or cookie-based sessions.

Session Example:

request.session['username'] = 'JohnDoe'
username = request.session.get('username', 'Guest')


10. What are querysets and managers in Django?
QuerySet: Represents a collection of database records.
Manager: Provides the API for database queries.

Example:

employees = Employee.objects.filter(department="HR")  # QuerySet
